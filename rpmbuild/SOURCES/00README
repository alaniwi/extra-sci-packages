When adding sources, either:

1) add the URL (and optional local file name) to the top-level
   source_urls file -- this will avoid adding the source to the repo
   for packages readily available from third-party sources, and is the
   preferred method

2) if this is not possible, then add the source itself to the
   "sources" directory, and 'git add' it to the repo

Run the get_sources.sh script at the top level. This will download any
sources from the source_urls to the "downloads" directory (which is in
.gitignore) apart from any already downloaded, and will create
symlinks from this directory pointing to all the downloaded sources as
well as links to all the locally provided sources.

This SOURCES directory is the one used by rpmbuild.  Everything other
than this 00README file will be ignored by git.  Do not put sources in
this directory as regular files.
