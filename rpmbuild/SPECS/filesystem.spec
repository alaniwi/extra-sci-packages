Summary: Package that owns various directories under %scl

BuildArch: noarch

%description

The purpose of this package is to own directories under %scl that are not otherwise owned by a package 
(which are created automatically as leading directories for various other packages).  This will help to 
remove unwanted empty directories if the SCL is removed.

%prep

    echo "WARNING - %scl_name should normally be installed before building"
    echo "Build is possible without it (to avoid a bootstrap problem) but you should rebuild this once it is installed"
    echo "so that all directories are captured"
    echo "press enter to continue / ctrl-c to abort..."
