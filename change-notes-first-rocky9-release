Packages from standard CentOS7 repository dropped because they are not
available in the standard Rocky9 repository.  Adding these would require
local builds; they could be considered if there are requests from multiple
users.

 - ElectricFence
 - emacs-gnuplot
 - grads
 - proj-epsg
 - proj-nad
 - proj-static
 - qt-devel
 - xemacs


Packages that were already using local builds, which have now been dropped.

lxterminal - xfce4-terminal from standard repo has been provided instead
             with similar functionality

diffuse - this is a python 2 package so cannot be supported on Rocky 9

udunits - now in Jaspy - was only provided in order to compile NCO
NCO - now back in latest Jaspy, so not needed in jasmin-sci

NCL - the release used precompiled executables from NCAR; no Rocky 9 version
      available; the CentOS7 version is not compatible with Rocky 9
